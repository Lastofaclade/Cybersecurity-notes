# Lan (Local Area Network)

## üï∏Ô∏è LAN Topologies

A **topology** describes how devices are connected in a **Local Area Network (LAN)**.

---

## üìö Common LAN Topologies

### 1. **Bus Topology**
- All devices share a single communication line (can't handle large amount of traffic)
- Cheap, but **single point of failure**
- Rarely used today

### 2. **Star Topology**
- All devices connect to a **central switch or hub**
- Easy to manage, scalable
- Expensive
- **Most common** LAN topology today

### 3. **Ring Topology**
- Devices form a closed loop
- Data travels in one direction
- Failure of one device can affect the entire network

# Switch
A device that connects devices **within the same network (LAN)**.  
It uses **MAC addresses** to send data **only to the correct device**, improving speed and efficiency.

# Router
A device that connects **multiple networks** together (e.g., your home network to the internet).  
It uses **IP addresses** to **route traffic** between networks, deciding where data should go.
