## IP (Internet Protocol) Address
- A label assigned to each device on a network to **send or receive data**
- Acts like the **address** of a device
- Without IP addresses, devices wouldn’t know where to send data

## 🔢 IPv4 vs IPv6
### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
- Most commonly used format
- Looks like this: `192.168.0.1`
- 4 numbers (octets), separated by dots
- Each number: 0 to 255

### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)
- Newer version, designed to replace IPv4
- Looks like: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
- More secure and efficient, but not yet fully adopted everywhere

## Public vs Private IP Addresses
### 🔐 Private IP:
- Used **inside a private network** (like home Wi-Fi)
- Not reachable from the internet

### 🌐 Public IP:
- Assigned by an **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**
- Can be accessed **from the internet**
- Used by routers, servers, websites, etc.
