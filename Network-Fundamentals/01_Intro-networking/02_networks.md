## üåê Networks
A **network** is a system of connected devices that communicate and share data with each other. These devices use **IP addresses** to identify and exchange information.

## üß† Why Networks Matter
- Without a network, devices (like phones and laptops) would be isolated
- A network allows:
  - Internet access
  - File sharing
  - Device communication

| Network Type     | Example               | Trust Level      |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Private Network** | Home, school wifi   | ‚úÖ High (controlled) |
| **Public Network**  | Airport, coffee shop wifi | ‚ùå Low (open, risky)  |
