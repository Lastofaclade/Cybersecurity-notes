# MAC (Media Access Control) Address
- A **hardware address**, also called **physical address**
- Assigned by the device manufacturer
- Stays the same unless manually changed (spoofed
- Used for **local communication**, not across the internet  
  **📝 Note:** When data leaves your local network, your **MAC address is replaced by the router’s MAC**, so websites and servers on the internet **can’t see your device’s MAC address**.
